# üöó ESP32 Line Following Delivery Robot

A line-following AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) built on **ESP32** with dual DC motors, rotary encoders, line sensors, and loadcell for automatic delivery tasks.  
The robot can detect intersections, brake, turn left/right based on payload weight, and send telemetry via UART ‚Üí WiFi ‚Üí MQTT.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Line following** with 7x TCRT5000 analog sensors + Lyapunov controller
- **Motor control**: DC motors with encoders, closed-loop RPM PID control
- **Load detection**: HX711 + loadcell to determine delivery direction
- **Profiles**:
  - Multiple speed/control profiles (e.g., 0.3 m/s, 0.7 m/s)
  - Switchable via long-press button
- **Intersection logic**:
  - Brake at first intersection
  - Decide left/right turn at second intersection based on payload weight
  - Stop at delivery zone
- **Telemetry**:
  - JSON over UART
  - ESP32 #2 bridges UART ‚Üí WiFi (MQTT) and beeps profile selection with a buzzer
- **Failsafes**:
  - Hard brake on lost line
  - Smooth ramp-up/down to avoid jerks
  - Profile auto-exit timeout

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software

### Main ESP32 (robot control)
- Reads line sensors
- Calculates error (TB, x)
- Lyapunov controller ‚Üí setpoints
- PID closed-loop RPM control
- State machine for delivery logic
- Sends telemetry JSON via UART

### ESP32 #2 (telemetry + buzzer)
- Receives UART JSON
- Publishes telemetry to MQTT (HiveMQ Cloud)
- Beeps when profile changes (1 beep = Profile 1, 2 beeps = Profile 2, etc.)
